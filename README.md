A RDW reference architecture

[ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡· í•œêµ­ì–´ README](https://github.com/SWM-SparkPlus/rdw-reference-architecture/blob/main/README.kr.md)

## Overview

As data-based decision making is in full swing, the demand for real-time data processing and analysis is also increasing. Accordingly, there is an increasing demand for startups and companies running legacy services to deploy RDW for an agile approach based on real-time data. Many cloud service providers and cooperative providers are providing related solutions, but it is not easy to get started due to the cost burden.

In response, the SPARK+ team discloses the architecture of the RDW that the data organization has built. It is implemented as free, scalable, and replaceable open sources in its infrastructure, which aims to serve the public interest so that any organization can start analyzing data at low cost.
